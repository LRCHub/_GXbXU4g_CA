Everything you try to do
Always seems to turn to shit
Every plan and stupid scheme
Can't you just give up and quit
Take it away
Just take it away

So don't phone me when you are down
And don't send me your joke emails
I'm not your friendly safety net

In fact I'm happy when you always fail
Take it away
Just take it away

I'm standing here
I can hear your voice
I don't want to any more
But it looks like you have given me
No choice
